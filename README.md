    2. `is_prime(x)`: 
    Checks if a given number is prime.

    3. `primes_n(p=100)`: 
    Prints all prime numbers less than p.

    4. `union(l1, l2)`: 
    Returns the union of two lists without duplicates.

    5. `flatten(l_s)`: 
    Flattens a list of lists into a single list.

    6. `prefix(l1, l2)`:
